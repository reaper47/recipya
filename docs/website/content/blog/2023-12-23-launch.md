Behold your trembling kitchen for [Recipya](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya) has been officially unleashed 
into the wild! 

I am pleased to finally show the world the recipe manager software I have been working hard on for at least a year.
You might ask why another recipes manager when we've got [Tandoor](https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes),
[Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie), [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/), 
[Grocy](https://grocy.info/), [Cooklist](https://cooklist.com/), [Grossr](https://grossr.com/), and a 
[*whole lot more*](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#recipe-management)? The answer is simple:
none of them satisfied my needs. Either they weren't free and opensource, had too many unneeded features, their frontend 
was slow, or they were too hard to install. Although I do have to admit Tandoor recipes is the king after having discovered it 
a few months back. 

And thus I started this ambitious project in [Go](https://go.dev). The goal was to create a simple, clean and powerful
recipe manager my whole family can enjoy. As with every other such solution, you can add recipes to your ever-growing
collection of recipes, create cookbooks, view and print recipes.
One big feature that differentiates Recipya from the 
others is its measurement systems module. Essentially, the software can convert all new recipes to your preferred 
measurement system, either the insatiable imperial or the mighty metric. Gone are the times when you convert all your 
teaspoons and cups to grams. Another powerful feature is the website scraper. Most other solutions are written in Python 
and thus use the [hhursev/recipe-scrapers](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers) package to import recipes from 
around the web. As there are none written in Go, I decided to create [my own](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/tree/main/internal/scraper)
from scratch. It is extensively-tested and fully supports [264](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/blob/main/internal/services/migrations/20230522154229_websites.sql#L11)
websites at the time of this writing. Another cool feature of Recipya is the automatic calculation of the nutrition facts
per 100g when adding a recipe.

Please give it a try! No worries if this software isn't for you :) The easiest way is to try the [demo](https://recipes.musicavis.ca).
Other ways include installing the v1.0.0 release locally or using Docker. You can follow the installation
[instructions](https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/docs/installation/).

And this marks the beginning of Recipya's journey. Contributions are
[encouraged and welcome](https://recipes.musicavis.ca/guide/about/community-guide/). The roadmap is 
available [here](/guide/about/roadmap/). Thank you!
