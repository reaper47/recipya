Recipya offers data import integrations with other recipe manager applications. 

You can import your recipes from Nextcloud Cookbook, Mealie and Tandoor using their respective APIs from the `Data` tab in the settings.
All you have to do is to select the solution you wish to import from, along with its base URL and your credentials.
