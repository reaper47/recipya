## Added

- 🔍 **Advanced search**: The advanced search lets you tweak your search query for the desired results. Please consult the [docs](guide/en/docs/features/recipes/search/) to learn how to use it.
- 🎩 **Configuration**: Added the ability to change most of the fields in the configuration file from the UI under the settings page.
- 🖱️ **Filter by category**: It is now possible to click the category of a recipe from the home page to display all recipes with the same category.
- 🪵 **Logs**: A logging mechanism has been introduced using [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog). The logs are stored 
  under `%APPDATA%\Recipya\Logs`. Logs rotate once a log file's size reaches 500MB. Up to three log files are stored at a time.
- 🧑‍💻 **Import from applications**: It is now possible to import recipes from the following applications. 
  - AccuChef
  - ChefTap
  - Crouton
  - Easy Recipe Deluxe
  - Kalorio
  - Mealie
  - Paprika
  - Recipe Keeper
  - RecipeSage
  - Saffron
  - Tandoor
- 🗝️ **Keywords**: Added a keywords section to the recipes.
- 📋 **Manage categories**: The user may now control their recipe categories from the settings dialog.
- 😻 **Mascot**: Bananacat is now Recipya's mascot.
- 📷 **Multiple images**: Support adding multiple pictures to recipes.
- 🏗️ **Recipe schema**: Added `nutrition.transFat`, `thumbnailUrl`, and `video` to the recipe schema.
- 🥘 **Subcategories**: Added the possibility to sub categorize categories. For example, the category `beverages:cocktails:vodka` means the following:
  - `beverage` is the main category
  - `cocktails` is a subcategory of `beverages`
  - `vodka` is a subcategory of `cocktails`
- 🧰 **Tools**: Added a tools section to the recipes.
- 🌊 **Transitions**: Added view transitions for when the user enters a recipe, selects a page from the pagination and when switch between
  tabs in the sidebar. This feature is not available in Firefox.
- 📺 **Videos**: Added the possibility to add videos to recipes.
- 🕸️ **Websites**: Added support for 109 websites, enumerated at the bottom of these notes.

## Fixed

- ➕ **Add to collection**: Fix the "Add recipe to collection" button not working.
- 🗸 **Approved websites**: Websites previously approved, but failed when added through the UI, have been fixed.
- 🙈 **Category list**: Fixed the category list in recipe edit mode not showing the user's list of categories.
- 🙊 **Cookbook deletion**: Fixed an issue where the wrong cookbook was deleted.
- 🏎️ **Data race**: Prevented a data race condition caused by concurrent reads and writes to the sessions map.
- 🗜️ **Image compression**: Fixed re-compressing images after every edit.
- 📏 **Ingredient conversion**: Fixed incorrect ingredient conversion.
- ⚖️ **Ingredient scaling**: Fixed some ingredient scaling issues.
- 🥳 **jamieoliver.com**: Improved the jamieoliver.com scraper. 
- 👑 **kingarthurbaking**: Refined parsing of kingarthurbaking.com.
- 🔨 **Maangchi.com**: Fixed and improved parsing of maangchi.com.
- 🔩 **Missing parenthesis**: Fix missing closing parenthesis to the first column header of the nutrition table.
- 🫘 **Normalize nutrition**: Normalized the nutritional properties.
- 🧮 **Nutrition calculation**: Calculate nutrition when the ingredients of a recipe are updated.
- 💣 **Recipe export**: Fixed a crash when exporting the recipes as PDF.
- ⭐ **Recipe imports**: The software used to import only part of the recipes from the exported JSON file. For example, if your exported ZIP file contained
  350 recipes, only 40 might be successfully imported. This issue has been fixed, ensuring that no recipe in the
  exported archive is skipped.
- 🍪 **Redirection**: Fixed a redirection error when logging in when a session cookie exists.
- 🪹 **Reload**: The page now does not reload when the search query is empty.
- 📥 **Restore backup**: Fixed user backup restoration when optional files in the backup archive are missing.

## Changed

- 💾 **Data directory**: The database has been moved from `path/to/recipya/data/backup/database/` to where user data is stored.
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Recipya`
  - Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Recipya`
  - MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Recipya`

Users do not have to take any action because the migration to the new folder is automatic on application startup.

- 📰️ **Documentation access**: Moved the link to the documentation from the about dialog to the avatar menu.
- 🩻 **Image file type**: Images are now stored in the WebP format rather than JPG for better compression and image quality.
- 🏛️ **Index page**: The mobile view index page of recipes and cookbooks now displays two columns instead of one.
- 1️⃣ **List of categories**: Only the first category is retained when inserting a recipe into the database.
- 🫧 **Notifications**: Most notifications are now sent through websockets instead of htmx, meaning all your open tabs will display the same sent notifications.
- 💧 **Platform support**: Dropped support for the following platforms because the software wouldn't compile:
  - Linux on 32-bit x86 architecture (linux/386).
  - Linux on ARMv6 architecture (linux/arm)
  - Linux on 64-bit RISC-V architecture (linux/riscv64)
  - Linux on IBM System z architecture (linux/s390x)
- 🍲 **Recipe category**: Setting the category is now optional and defaults to 'uncategorized' when unset.
- 🖹 **Recipe description**: The description field is now optional. Also hide the section on mobile if empty.
- 🚫 **Recipe fields (manual)**: Missing required fields now throws an error.
- 📦 **Recipe JSON export**: The zip archive of the exported recipes in the JSON format now contains only JSON files, one per recipe. Before, we
  had a folder per recipe. Each contained the recipe's image and its JSON schema. Including the image files in the archive
  is not necessary anymore as images and thumbnails are now in the recipe schema.
- 🚜 **Recipe source**: Setting the source is now optional and defaults to 'Unknown' when unset.
- 3️⃣ **Recipe yield**: An unset yield now defaults to 1.
- ⌨️ **Searchbar shortcut**: Removed the `Crtl + /` shortcut to focus the searchbar.
- 🌙 **Search mode**: The search mode has been removed in favour of an advanced search.
- 🖥️ **Server URL**: The `server.url` configuration variable and `RECIPYA_SERVER_URL` environment variable are now optional and default to `http://0.0.0.0`
- ⚙️ **Settings**: The settings have been revamped for a cleaner, more polished look inspired from ChatGPT's and Open WebUI's settings dialog.
- 🈴 **OCR engine**: Deprecated the use of [Azure AI Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-vision) to digitize
  recipes in favor of [Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
  because it is more accurate and accepts multiple file formats.

**Important**: The *integrations.azureComputerVision* block in the configuration file and the
`RECIPYA_VISION_ENDPOINT`/`RECIPYA_VISION_KEY` environment variables are deprecated and will be removed in v1.3.0.

To migrate:
1. Add the *Document intelligences* resource to your [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com/#allservices)
2. Access the resource.
3. From the sidebar, select *Keys and Endpoint* under *Resource Management*.
   ![alt text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png?view=doc-intel-3.1.0)
4. Copy *KEY 1* to your configuration file's **integrations.azureDocumentIntelligence.key** field or `RECIPYA_DI_KEY` environment variable if you use Docker.
5. Copy *Endpoint* to your configuration file's **integrations.azureDocumentIntelligence.endpoint** field or `RECIPYA_DI_ENDPOINT` environment variable if you use Docker.
6. Restart Recipya and test the *Azure AI Document Intelligence* connection from the settings.

- **Limitations**
  - For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
  - The file size for analyzing documents is 500 MB for paid (S0) tier and 4 MB for free (F0) tier.
  - If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.
