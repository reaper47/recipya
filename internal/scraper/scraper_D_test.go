Note that this sauce will take a while to prepare. It&#39;s mostly downtime. At first, you&#39;re just sauteeing ingredients, stirring until they&#39;re combined, then adding wine and milk, simmering and stirring until those have been absorbed. Once the tomatoes have been added, that&#39;s when you let the sauce cook at the lowest heat possible, stirring every once in a while, until it&#39;s ready. Within an hour, it comes together into a nice paste, but if you cook it another hour, nursing it with water as you go, you&#39;ll get a sauce with a richer flavor. One of Hazan&#39;s recipes says to cook sauce Bolognese for up to 4 hours! In the untraditional category, some people like to grate from Parmesan cheese over finished bowls of pasta.",
