class="pantry--ui">While pasta is cooking, mix raw egg in a bowl with cheese and black pepper until whites and yolks are mixed, cook bacon in strips or cubes in a frying pan. When pasta is ready mix everything together in another bowl (not a hot one) and mix well. If you like you can add more cheese. This is "Pasta alla carbonara". Very popular in Italy. In my recipe the egg is added raw, and it gets slightly cooked by the contact with hot pasta.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 663</span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Midge</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">6 years ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">I've been making this for years and have discovered you get a better result by separating the eggs, cooking only the whites, then adding the raw yolks at the end.

Dinner's a different matter.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"> 172</span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Max</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">6 years ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">You can also simply cook pasta, drain it, then stir in an egg.

Used thin spaghetti for "fluffier" mouthfeel, included cheese (necessary, IMO). Timing on eggs a bit tricky, to have them end at the same time as pasta and still be runny. Did a quick over-easy to get the raw white on the top (around yolk) to cook. Finished in fry pan (for drier texture) with a splash of pasta water and generous dusting of cheese and pepper, and drizzle raw olive oil.

Still easy and SO GOOD.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"></span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Lauren LG</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">3 days ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">Favorite dish in our house.

Oh my goodness, I can't stop eating it...</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj"><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d">Is this helpful?</span><span class="noteactions_recommendationsCount__pdQnY"><svg width="18" height="13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="noteactions_thumbsUpIcon__48HYT"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.816.694c-.478 0-.698.284-.698.284s.049 1.822.049 2.244c0 .421-2.089 3.79-2.6 4.222-.51.434-1.778 1.173-1.778 1.173-1.514 3.645.347 5.126.347 5.126h.978c.364 0 .814.56 1.307.56h6.39c1.528 0 2.052-1.945.525-1.945 1.528 0 2.054-1.943.526-1.943 1.529 0 2.053-1.947.524-1.947 1.529 0 2.053-1.944.524-1.944h-5.154c.187-.74.53-3.104.53-3.104-.076-1.144-.845-2.586-.845-2.586a1.608 1.608 0 0 0-.625-.14Zm0 .26c.135 0 .283.028.44.085.156.314.7 1.453.771 2.373-.039.268-.352 2.374-.521 3.05l-.081.32h5.486c.23 0 .412.052.524.152a.413.413 0 0 1 .134.321c0 .39-.42.955-1.183.955v.515c.232 0 .413.054.524.154a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .392-.421.956-1.18.956v.517c.23 0 .41.053.523.151a.413.413 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .393-.421.958-1.183.958v.516c.231 0 .413.051.525.15a.406.406 0 0 1 .133.32c0 .394-.422.959-1.184.959H7.42c-.19 0-.405-.14-.612-.272-.23-.15-.45-.291-.694-.291h-.879c-.296-.292-1.457-1.684-.24-4.688.286-.169 1.286-.768 1.74-1.153.53-.45 2.688-3.886 2.688-4.42 0-.363-.034-1.727-.045-2.137a.72.72 0 0 1 .438-.131Z" fill="#fff"></path><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__a" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__a)"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M9.815 0c-.604 0-1.05.295-1.249.55a.713.713 0 0 0-.148.447c0 .017.042 1.645.047 2.156-.212.61-1.954 3.406-2.352 3.764-.378.32-1.338.9-1.676 1.098a.693.693 0 0 0-.293.333c-1.696 4.084.463 5.866.557 5.94.125.098.202.377.434.246l.286-.96c-.05.033.799.957.87 1.002.278.177.659.422 1.129.422h6.39c1.28 0 2.142-.986 2.142-1.909 0-.212-.217-.408-.3-.59.412-.367.821-.87.821-1.353 0-.21-.213-.409-.296-.59.412-.366.822-.87.822-1.355 0-.21-.215-.41-.296-.587.412-.37.822-.871.822-1.359a1.36 1.36 0 0 0-.454-1.031c-.2-.18-.567-.394-1.161-.394h-4.303c.176-.972.361-2.236.372-2.306.007-.05.008-.1.004-.15-.086-1.28-.892-2.802-.927-2.866a.703.703 0 0 0-.344-.316A2.391 2.391 0 0 0 9.815 0Zm0 .694c.175 0 .383.04.626.142 0 0 .769 1.44.845 2.584 0 0-.344 2.363-.53 3.106h4.983c1.528 0 1.002 1.943-.526 1.943 1.53 0 1.003 1.947-.525 1.947 1.529 0 1.004 1.94-.525 1.94 1.529 0 1.175 1.946-.353 1.946H7.42c-.493 0-2.28-2.037-2.28-2.037s-1.866-.003-.351-3.647c0 0 1.267-.741 1.779-1.174.51-.434 2.598-3.8 2.598-4.222C9.166 2.8 9.118.98 9.118.98s.219-.286.697-.286Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g><mask id="thumbs-up_svg__b" style="mask-type:alpha" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="18" height="15"><path d="M.262 0h17.261v14.997H.262V0Z" fill="#fff"></path></mask><g mask="url(#thumbs-up_svg__b)" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"><path d="M4.791 14.49H.605V6.656h4.186v7.834Z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M.952 14.146h3.496V7H.952v7.147Zm3.84.687H.606a.346.346 0 0 1-.344-.343V6.656a.344.344 0 0 1 .344-.345h4.186a.346.346 0 0 1 .345.345v7.834a.344.344 0 0 1-.345.343Z" fill="currentColor"></path></g></svg><span class="pantry--ui noteactions_fontOverride__Hja9d"></span></span></span></button></div></div></div><div class="note_note__vjhlc"><header class="note_noteHeader__illrc"><div class="note_noteMetadata__0yk9F"><span class="pantry--ui-strong note_noteOwner__6bK1r"><span class="note_displaySpace__ekDvv">Gemma</span></span><time class="pantry--ui-sm note_noteTime__yIrp_">2 months ago</time></div></header><div class="note_noteBody__7UXUQ"><p class="pantry--ui">I grew up on pastina, made it for my children, who still ask me to make it for them now that they're adults.

Add a small pasta (acini di pepe, orzo, alphabets, etc) to salted boiling water. When al dente, pour off excess water, leaving about 2 inches. Whisk in a couple of eggs. When just cooked (don't overcook) remove from heat & serve immediately. Add salt and pepper as needed. 
It will thicken as it sits. Just add boiling water to the leftovers.</p><div class="noteactions_noteActions__VlyP0"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k noteactions_linkAppearance__DQAM2"
