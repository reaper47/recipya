<h4>Directions</h4>
<div class="instructions"><ol> <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li> <li>Add the oil to a large pot and turn heat to medium. Finely chop the mushrooms until they’re roughly the size of peas. Add chopped mushrooms to the pot along with minced garlic and a pinch of salt. Stir until combined. Sauté for about 6 to 8 minutes, until the water from the mushrooms cooks off, reducing heat to low if necessary to prevent burning.</li> <li>Meanwhile, tear the kale into large pieces and place into a food processor.

<h4>Tip:</h4><p><span class="gold">*</span> You can save a tiny bit of chopping time by buying sliced mushrooms instead of whole. You’ll still need to dice them up finely, but it’ll go a little faster with the first chop already done for you!</p>
<p><span class="gold">*</span><span class="gold">*</span> You can toast the walnuts beforehand, but this step is optional. Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C) and toast the walnuts on a baking sheet for 9 to 12 minutes, until lightly crisp and fragrant.</p>
<p>MAKE-AHEAD OPTIONS: You can store the uncooked balls in the fridge (tightly wrapped up on a plate) for up to 36 hours before baking so there's less fuss the day of a big meal. The uncooked balls can also be frozen in a freezer-safe zip bag for 1 to 2 weeks. To bake, simply pop the frozen balls on a prepared baking sheet and bake for 30 to 32 minutes (they need roughly 7 to 9 minutes more bake time when baking from frozen). The Cranberry-Pear Sauce can also be made 1 to 2 weeks in advance and frozen until ready to use.</p>

I made these today and tried the unbaked filling today. Amazing! Thank you again for your awesome recipes! I am especially thankful that this is bread-free as I seem to have inflammation from white flour. ((Alas, my mom&#8217;s stuffing had to go this year.) Have a wonderful time with your husband and kids this weekend! Blessings to you all!</p>

    <p>These were so yummy, crunchy on the outside with great flavor (I&#8217;ll follow the upper end of your salt recommendation next time). I can&#8217;t find canned lentils where I live (is that a Canadian thing?), so I&#8217;m not sure the ratio was right. How many cups would you use if you are just cooking and draining the lentils?</p>

    <p>Hey Christy, Oh that&#8217;s a great Q about swapping cooked lentils. I think there are roughly 1 1/2 cups of lentils in the can so you&#8217;d probably be safe to swap that amount. I&#8217;m so glad you enjoyed them!</p>

Even the skeptics loved it! Didn’t miss the meat one bit. Baked  at 350 for about an hour. Next time I make this in loaf form, I will double the recipe, as it doesn’t fill a standard loaf pan.  Thanks for this healthy comfort food recipe. I can’t wait to make this again!</p>

    <p>Hey Lisa,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed response I just noticed this now. When ingredients are &#8220;crossed out&#8221; in the app it is actually a feature that you are able to cross out the ingredients yourself. The idea is that you can cross things off either while grocery shopping or while cooking to track your progress. So most likely it was crossed out because you accidentally hit it. Another feature with the ingredient list is if you tap on an ingredient and hold it will pop up a menu and you can copy the list so that you can paste it into another program whether you want to email, text, or just create a grocery list in a different app. Hope this helps!</p>

Very yummy.  This was my first vegan Thanksgiving and I thought I would miss the poultry seasoning/sage flavour, but I didn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t miss the turkey either!  I too put the mushrooms in my 7-cup KitchenAid food processor. But after a couple of pulses, I saw that some were getting way too small with others hardly touched. So I took them out and finished with a knife.  In future, I&#8217;m sticking with the knife because I prefer the texture with the larger pieces. My 11-year old son, who is having a very hard time with this vegan transition, gave them a 4 out of 10 (which is high praise from him!)  I give them a 10 out of 10! Thanks Angela!</p>

    <p>Hi Angela! I am very new to your site. I am making the Spicy Vegetable soup today. I followed your recipe, but when I just checked the soup, I noticed the cocanut milk has separated. Is this normal?<br />
Your recipes look amazing. I am trying to eat healthier, so I will be trying a lot more recipes.<br />
Thanks</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve made these a couple of times and even my non-vegan family members love them! But they&#8217;re a bit time consuming&#8230;.do you think they could be made into a loaf to avoid rolling the balls?  I&#8217;m thinking I could and maybe just bake it a little longer?</p>

The book includes 1 cup parsley leaves (not an ingredient that appears in your above recipe), only 1 cup (vs. the 2 cups in your on-line recipe) of kale, and 1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp. Gluten-Free Oats (vs. only 1/2 cup noted above).    Do the differences matter?</p>
<p>I made these Stuffing Balls last night.  Unfortunately, they were extremely dry and a bit bland.  What could be done to moisten them a bit and enhance the flavors?  (I should note that I combined the ground flaxseed and the sherry vinegar quite a bit in advance of adding the combination to the mix, so perhaps this had an effect on the outcome?)</p>

The cranberry-pear sauce was DELICIOUS! I only used 1/4 cup of maple syrup (half the amount in the recipe) + 2 T of water and it was perfect. That recipe is a keeper, and I&#8217;ll also experiment with adding fresh or frozen sweet cherries. The stuffing balls were delicious, but a bit dry for my taste. Any suggestions for adding moisture? More mushrooms? More kale? Thanks for any tips!</p>
