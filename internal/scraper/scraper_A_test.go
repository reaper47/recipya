					Value: "Equipment Notes:\r\nAs noted above, I find a scale to be imperative here: I use it to weigh not only the flour but also the water, salt, and yeast.\r\nA large sheet pan is so handy — it fits all 12 bagels at once. If you don't have a large one, use two standard sheet pans, and bake 6 on each.\r\nYou'll need a spider or a slotted spoon to remove the bagels from the boiling water to a sheet pan.\r\nA food processor or stand mixer will allow you to knead the dough quickly and powerfully. I love my 14-cup Cuisinart.\r\nNote: Watch your food processor closely! If you make the larger amount (12 bagels), it's a lot of dough for even a large food processor. You'll only run the machine for 90 seconds, but it will work hard during those 90 seconds and may jump around a bit — at any sign of the blade jamming, stop the machine and remove the dough. Also, after you add the liquids to the food processor, begin the kneading immediately to prevent the liquid from escaping through the center hole.\r\nIf you don't have a food processor or a stand mixer, knead the dough by hand briefly, using as little additional flour as possible.\r\nIngredient Notes:\r\nMany bread authorities swear by using high-gluten flour.This is something I have yet to try, but I imagine it would only improve the chewiness. But if you don't feel like picking up another product, don't hesitate to use all-purpose flour, which is what I typically use in all of the breads I bake.\r\nBarley malt syrup is hard to find. Shops like Whole Foods Market typically sell it. I order it online. Also, as one commenter noted, beer making supply stores carry barley malt syrup.\r\nFor homemade everything bagel seasoning, combine:\r\n\r\n1/4 cup sesame seeds\r\n1/4 cup poppy seeds\r\n3 tablespoons dried onion flakes\r\n3 tablespoons dried garlic flakes\r\n2 tablespoons flaky sea salt",

Form each portion into a ball, using the pinky edges of your fingers to create tension. After all of the balls have been formed, dust your hands with flour and use your thumb to poke a hole into the center of each dough ball. Use your hands to stretch the dough into a donut-shape—don’t be afraid to really tug outward and under, almost as if you were going to turn the dough inside out but stop before you do.

					Value: "I can finally say, after tinkering with my original recipe on and off for a decade, this is the apple pie I want when I want apple pie, a craving that rises constant in me from the first rattle of fall leaves. We&#039;ve upped the grains of paradise (see note below), traded out the apple cider for apple cider vinegar, and enhanced the texture by inviting liquid pectin to the party, easily found in most mega marts. We&#039;ve also changed the apple mixture, replacing the original golden delicious with Pink Lady. I realize some of you may not be able to land these where you live, so feel free to replace whose with Winesaps, or just stick with Honeycrisps and Granny Smiths.Some of you will notice that I&#039;ve eschewed the pie bird relied upon in earlier iterations. As much as I dig their retro-homey vibe, truth is, slitting the top crust does as good a job of venting. Yes, the top crust does sometimes crack without the bird there to support the middle, but so what...I&#039;m going to eat it and I trust you will too.This recipe first appeared on altonbrown.com.Photo by Lynne Calamia",
