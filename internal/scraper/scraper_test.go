						"Prep. To create the blue cheese dip,take the cream cheese and the blue cheese out of the fridge and let them come to room temp. Then smush them together with the spices. Mix in the sour cream and half and half. Put them in a serving bowl and refrigerate. You can do this a day ahead. Cut up the celery into 4-inch (10 cm) sections and put it back in the chiller.",
						"For the Buffalo hot sauce,melt the butter over a low heat and then adding the garlic. Let it simmer for about a minute but don't let the garlic brown. Then add the Frank's RedHot sauce. Let them get to know each other for at least 3 to 4 minutes. But remember, if you don't want to use the original and you want to get creative, try one or more of the other sauces listed above. I'm partial to DC Mumbo Sauce. Like the dip, the sauce can be made a day in advance.",
						"When it comes time to prep the wings, note that there are three distinct pieces of different thickness and skin to meat ratio: (1) The tips (2) the flats or wingettes in the center, and (3) the drumettes on the end that attaches to the shoulders. The thickness differences means they cook at different speeds and finish at different times. The best thing to do is separate them into three parts with kitchen shears, a sturdy knife, or a Chinese cleaver (my weapon of choice because the ka-chunk noise of chopping them off is so very satisfying).",
						"The tips are almost all skin, really thin, and small enough that they often fall through the grates or burn to a crisp. You can cook them if you wish, but I freeze them for use in making soup. Separate the V shaped piece remaining at the joint between the flat and drumette. You will cook both these parts.",
						"Some folks like to season them with a spice rub. That works most of the time. I find that most commercial rubs are too salty for such thin cuts, and most have too much sugar that tends to burn during the crisping phase. Besides, they just get lost under the sauces and dips. So I just season them with salt and pepper. As Rachael Ray says: &quot;Easy peasy.&quot;",
						"Fire up. You can start them on a smoker if you wish, but I usually grill them. Set up the grill for 2-zone cooking with the indirect side at about 325°F (162.8°C) to help crisp the skin and melt the fat. If you wish, add wood to the direct side to create smoke. Use a lot of smoke.",
						"Cook. Add the wings to the indirect heat side of the grill and cook with the lid closed until the skins are golden. That will probably take about 7 to 10 minutes per side. By then they are pretty close to done.",
						"To crisp the skin,move the wings to the direct heat side of your grill, high heat, lid open, and stand there, turning frequently until the skin is dark golden to brown but not burnt, keeping a close eye on the skinnier pieces, moving them to the indirect zone when they are done.",
						"Serve. Put the sauce in a big mixing bowl or pot and put it on the grill and get it warm. Stir or whisk well. Keep warm. When the wings are done you can serve them with the sauce on the side for dipping, or just dump them in with the sauce and toss or stir until they are coated. Then slide them onto a serving platter. Put the celery sticks next to them, and serve with a bowl of Blue Cheese Dip. People can scoop some Blue Cheese Sauce on their plates, and dip in the celery and wings.",

Tip - At any time the beef is slow cooking and you feel like it needs a bit more beef broth, it's fine to add a bit more, to taste.",
						"In the last 15 minutes of slow cooking, cook the egg noodles in a pot of boiling water according to package directions; drain and set aside.* (See Notes about why I don't cook the noodles in the slow cooker and cook them separately.)",
						"Optionally, if you want a creamier sauce, after the beef stroganoff has cooked and has cooled a bit meaning it's not boiling nor bubbling, slowly you can add 1/2-cup heavy cream at room temperature while whisking vigorously as you add it. Tip - Do NOT add cold cream to hot beef liquid because the dairy proteins can separate, or break, and you will end up with a horribly ugly looking sauce after hours and hours slow cooking. So make sure the cream is at room temp and the beef stroganoff has cooled a bit if you are adding cream.",
						"Plate a bed of noodles, top with the beef and gravy mixture, and serve immediately. Extra beef stroganoff will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days and in the freezer for up to 4 months. Tip - Because the noodles will continue to absorb moisture, including any of the beef gravy or sauce, it's very important to store the beef mixture and the noodles separately in the fridge or freezer.",

The rice should be bubbling gently and each addition should be mostly absorbed before more stock is added. After 15-20 mins the rice should be tender with a slight chalky bite. The overall consistency should be saucy but not sloppy – you should be able to see the bottom of the pan when you draw a spoon through it.",

If you have a gas grill where the coals are not movable, either turn off the middle burner or just put a drip pan made of aluminum foil directly over the center burner.  To make a foil drip pan, just tear 3 pieces of foil about 16 inches long, overlap them so they are the width you want, then fold the edges up about 2 inches to form a make-shift drip pan.",
						"After setting up the grill, preheat it on high.  Turn the grill down and place the roast over the drip pan.  Adjust heat or coals so the internal temperature rests at about 350 F.  This will ensure nice browning without burning, and should result in a cook time of about 2 hours.  Turn the meat occasionally during cooking so all sides get equally browned, and rub on additional spice mixture if any.",
						"Transfer roast to cutting board or platter and let stand for 10 minutes before removing strings and cutting into thin slices to serve.",

						"Start by maxing up a batch of keto roti dough. While the dough is resting you will want to make the filling.",
						"To make the filling heat the oil in a skillet. When the oil is hot add the seasoning(cumin, ginger, Garam masala), garlic, and jalapeno to the skillet. Saute in the skillet for about 1 minute then add the rest of the filling ingredients to the skillet. Let the filling cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occassionally. Once the filling is done remove it from the heat and let it cool completely.",
						"While the filling is cooling prepare and shape the samosas wrappers. To do this cut your roti dough into 6 equal sections. Form each section into a ball. Roll each ball into a thin circle about the size of a side plate between two sheets of parchment paper using a rolling pin.Then using a knife cut each circle in half. This will give you 12 samosa wrappers. Cover and set aside until filling is completely cool.",
						"Start by laying out one samosa wrapper with the flat cut side toward the bottom. Use your finger to brush water in a line along half of the flat cut side. This will help the wrapper stick together as you fold it.",
						"Next, fold the two corner edges up to make a cone. Overlap the corners with the wet edge on top of the other. Firmly press the seam down to ensure it sticks and pinch the bottom of the cone closed.",
						"Hold the cone upright and open in your hand with the seam facing your palm. Your palm will help support the seam while you add the filling. Spoon the filling into the cone until it is 2/3 of the way full.",
						"Using your finger brush water around the inside edge of the cone. Then press the edges of the cone together and fold the bottom under to seal the cone and form a triangular samosa. Place the samosa down so that it is standing up with the sealed bottom facing down. Repeast until all 12 samosas are filled.",
						"Finally, brush the samosas with olive oil and cook one of 3 ways.1) Bake in the oven on a baking tray at 190°C/375°F for 15-18 minutes or until the samosas are golden brown.2) Arrange the samosas in your air fryer basket and air at 190°C/375°F for 7-8 minutes. Depending on the size of your air fryer you may need to cook the samosas in batches.3) Add an inch of olive oil to a skillet and fry the samosas over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes on each side. Only cook 3-4 samosas at a time. Let the samosas cool for a few minutes after cooking and enjoy.",

					Value: "For this sheet pan dinner, baby potatoes, red onion, and spring onions get a head start in a hot oven, before they are joined by a side of salmon, slathered with mustard and drizzled with toasted garlic oil, which cooks alongside the vegetables for a seamless final presentation. Sommelier Erin Miller, of Charlie Palmer's Dry Creek Kitchen in Healdsburg, California, who provided the inspiration for this dish, notes that it tastes even better when served with a great wine. She recommends a glass of Hirsch Vineyards Raschen Ridge Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, noting, \"The bright acidity of the Hirsch Pinot Noir is a perfect foil for the fresh, fatty fish and flavors of garlic and lemon.\"",

Complete with classic recipes, dishes from collaborators like Bar Tartine, a chicken wing salad and a short story from Harold McGee, this book is one for the truest and quirkiest of burger lovers. When you're craving burgers but don't have a meat grinder at home, opt for this hand-cut burger recipe.</em>\n\nNo grinder? No problem. My friend Michael Black, a San Francisco sushi chef, once told me that the only burger worth eating is the one you cut by hand. A hand-cut burger is a nice option for a smaller group, or a sophisticated dinner party where you can sing the praises of beef tallow. This recipe magically turns a single steak into dinner for four.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Burger-Believe-Recipes-Fundamentals/dp/0399579265?tag=foodrepu-20\" target=\"_blank\">Reprinted with permission from\u00a0<em>A Burger To Believe In</em></a>",

						"1 (5-ounce) piece horseradish (2 to 3 inches), finely grated",
						"2 tablespoons buttermilk",

						"Chill the steak in the freezer until firm to the touch but not frozen, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut the steak into 1⁄4-inch-thick slices, then slice into 1⁄4-inch-thick strips, and then into 1⁄4-inch cubes. Remove the sinew and connective tissue but keep the fat.",
						"Divide the beef into four equal balls. Put a sheet of plastic wrap over a 4-inch ring mold on a cutting board or other hard surface. Put a ball in the middle of the mold and gently press down with the palm of your hand, forming a patty that is 4 inches wide. Pop it out with the plastic wrap. Put the patties on a large dish or small baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to cook.",
						"Melt 2 cups of the butter in a pot over medium heat. (Why yes, that is a lot of butter, but it’s used to fully submerge the onion while it cooks; you will not eat\u00a02 cups of butter in this burger.) Add the onion, turn the heat to low, and gently cook at a bare simmer until the onion is tender, about 20 minutes. The onion should be cooked but still al dente, so there’s some texture and a slight hit of sharpness yet not enough that you’ll taste onion the rest of the day. Remove the onion from the butter and drain on a paper towel.",
						"While the onion cooks, make a horseradish sauce. In a bowl, mix the grated horseradish with the buttermilk and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine and refrigerate until ready to use.",
						"Before you begin cooking the burgers, get the buns toasting. Heat a cast-iron skillet or similar surface over medium-low heat. Slice the buns in half horizontally. Smear the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter on the buns and place, butter side down, on the hot surface, working in batches if necessary. Toast until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, adjusting the heat if necessary. You want to do your best to time their completion to the burger cooking.",
						"While the buns toast, cook the patties. Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill over high heat. Use a spatula to handle the patty—it will be loose, so be careful. Salt both sides of each patty and put them on the hot skillet. Cook on one side, about 1 minute, then flip the patties and cook until rare, another minute.",
						"Place a patty on a bottom bun and top with some pickles and onions. Slather 1 1⁄2 teaspoons horseradish sauce on the top bun and cap it off. Repeat.",

Either a smoky barbecue sauce or Frank’s hot sauce would work well, but if you are like me and prefer sweet and spicy, then try a little bit of both. Serve with ranch or Caesar dressing on the side if you wish, or whip up a batch of Spinach Ranch Dip.

Prepare a bain marie by filling a pan of water and sitting a heatproof bowl snugly over the top (ensuring the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water). Whisk together the miso, sugar, mirin and sake and pour into the bowl. Cook over a high heat for about 20 minutes, stirring continuously. Remove and chill",
						"Make the marinade by mixing 100ml of the den miso and the chillies together. Use a sharp knife to cut each poussin clean in half and make a couple of score marks, one in the fat part of the drumsticks and one in the thighs. Marinate in the miso-chilli marinade for at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours",
						"To make the dip, whisk together all the ingredients, except the oil. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. This will keep in the fridge for a month",
						"To make the salad, thinly slice the daikon on a Japanese mandoline and layer the slices in piles of 5 or 6. Using a knife, shred very thinly. Do the same with the carrot and cucumber and mix together. Add the mint and coriander leaves and drizzle with the yuzu, soy sauce and extra virgin olive oil",
						"Set up your barbecue and get the charcoal very hot. Once the flames start to die down a little and the embers begin to glow, put your poussins on the grill. If you’re concerned about the poussins not being cooked through enough and burning, take off the barbecue and finish cooking in a hot oven, about 180°C/gas mark 4 for 8–10 minutes. To check the birds are done, insert a thin metal skewer or the sharp end of small knife into the thickest part of the thigh, pause for a couple of seconds, then hold the skewer to your lip; if its scorching hot they're done",
						"Once cooked, serve with the daikon salad and the dip on the side",

We hadden een tijdje geleden een stuk gruyère kaas gekocht bij de kaasboer, meer uit nood want parmezaanse had hij op dat moment even niet. Inmiddels lag de kaas al een tijdje in de koelkast en moesten we er toch echt wat mee gaan doen. Iemand tipte ons dat we echt eens gougères moesten maken en eerlijk gezegd hadden we er nooit eerder van gehoord. Een kleine speurtocht bracht ons uiteindelijk bij een recept van ‘The Guardian – How to make the perfect gougères‘. We zijn ermee aan de slag gegaan en zie hier het resultaat! \n\nNog meer van dit soort lekkere snacks en borrelhapjes vind je in onze categorie tapas recepten en tussen de high-tea recepten.",

Schep met twee lepels kleine bolletjes deeg op de bakplaat of gebruik hiervoor een spuitzak.

Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sweetener to taste, cacao for rich chocolate flavor, maca for malty flavor, or coconut butter for coconut flavor / butteriness. The adaptogens / mushrooms can be a bit on the bitter side, so adding more coconut butter, cacao, and sweetener will offset this.",

Although this game day-perfect platter of beefy, cheesy nachos comes together quickly and relies largely on store-bought shortcuts, it delivers the classic meld of flavors and textures that you want from everyone&rsquo;s favorite appetizer. For this nachos recipe, we combine the meat and nacho cheese elements to create a Ro*Tel Dip-inspired, beefy cheese sauce. This guarantees an even distribution of the hearty toppings and keeps you from having to crank up the oven. However, if you prefer melted, shredded cheese over a nacho cheese sauce, simply cook your ground beef in a skillet on the stovetop, drain, and distribute over the nachos on a sheet pan. Then, top the platter with shredded cheese and pop it under the broiler until melty and glorious (no Ro*Tel required).",

					Value: "My recipe tester Nicole likes to call these “bread-free stuffing balls,” and I think I would have to agree! These festive bites have all the flavours of traditional stuffing, but they’re protein-packed, bite-sized, and gluten-free as well. This is a new and improved version of my popular Lentil Mushroom Walnut Balls recipe. I've streamlined the procedure and provided a make-ahead version in the Tips below. This recipe moves quickly using quite a few components, so my advice is to gather all of the ingredients and do as much prep as you can before you begin. If you aren't a cranberry sauce fan, my Vegan Mushroom Gravy is a nice option too!",

Add chopped mushrooms to the pot along with minced garlic and a pinch of salt. Stir until combined. Sauté for about 6 to 8 minutes, until the water from the mushrooms cooks off, reducing heat to low if necessary to prevent burning.",
						"Meanwhile, tear the kale into large pieces and place into a food processor. Pulse (do not process) the kale until finely chopped (pieces roughly the size of almonds), being careful not to overprocess it. Remove and place into a bowl for later.",
						"To the processor (no need to clean it out!), add the rolled oats. Process the oats until they’re finely chopped and resemble coarse flour, about 30 seconds.",
						"Add the drained lentils and walnuts to the processor bowl with the oat flour. Pulse the mixture, stopping to check on it every few pulses, until it’s coarsely chopped. Be sure not to overprocess it into a paste as you still want a lot of texture and crunchy walnut pieces. Set aside.",

						"Stir the flax and water together in a small cup (no need to let it sit).",
						"Now add all of the food processor contents, vinegar, and flax mixture to the pot. Stir until thoroughly combined. The dough should be heavy and dense. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
						"With lightly wet hands, shape and roll about 14 to 15 balls, roughly 3 to 4 tablespoons of dough each. Place them on the prepared baking sheet about two inches apart.",
						"Bake for 22 to 24 minutes, until golden on the bottom and firm to touch. Remove and let cool for 5 minutes.",
						"While the Bread-Free Stuffing Balls are baking, make the Cranberry-Pear Sauce. Add the cranberries, pear, maple syrup, and salt to a medium pot. Bring to a low boil over high heat and then reduce to medium. Simmer uncovered for 10 to 20 minutes until thickened. Use a potato masher to mash up the pear near the end of cooking, if desired.",
						"Leftover balls can be refrigerated in an airtight container for a few days. To reheat, add oil to a skillet and fry over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until heated through.",

					Values: []string{
						"To help guarantee success, I recommend reading through the recipe, watching the video tutorial, and reading the explanations below this recipe. (All answer many FAQs.) Do not use an electric mixer for this dough. It&#8217;s best if the dough is folded together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula since it is so sticky. There is very minimal mixing required.",
						"Whisk the warm water, yeast, and 1 Tablespoon (6g) of sugar together in a large bowl. Cover and allow to rest until foamy on top, about 5 minutes. If the surface doesn&#8217;t have bubbles on top or look foamy after 15 minutes (it should if the yeast isn&#8217;t expired), start over with a fresh packet of yeast. Whisk in remaining sugar, the milk, egg, and salt. Once these wet ingredients are mixed together, lightly cover and set the bowl aside as you work on the next step.",
						"Cut the cold butter into 1/4 inch slices and add to a food processor or blender. Top with 2 and 1/2 cups flour. Pulse the mixture 12-15 times, until butter is crumbled into pea-size bits. See photo below for a visual. Using a food processor or blender is best for this dough. Keeping that in mind, if you don&#8217;t have one, you can use a pastry cutter to work in the butter.",
						"Pour the flour mixture into the wet yeast mixture. Very gently fold everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Fold *just until* the dry ingredients are moistened. The butter must remain in pieces and crumbles, which creates a flaky pastry. Turn the sticky dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, parchment paper, aluminum foil, or into any container you can tightly cover.",
						"Wrap the dough/cover up tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 48 hours.",
						"Take the dough out of the refrigerator to begin the “rolling and folding” process. If the dough sat for more than 4 hours, it may have slightly puffed up and that&#8217;s ok. (It will deflate as you shape it, which is also ok.) Very generously flour a work surface. The dough is very sticky, so make sure you have more flour nearby as you roll and fold. Using the palm of your hands, gently flatten the dough into a small square. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a 15&#215;8 inch rectangle. When needed, flour the work surface and dough as you are rolling. Fold the dough into thirds as if it were a business letter. (See photos and video tutorial.) Turn it clockwise and roll it out into a 15 inch long rectangle again. Then, fold into thirds again. Turn it clockwise. You’ll repeat rolling and folding 1 more time for a total of 3 times.",
						"Wrap up/seal tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. You can also freeze the dough at this point. See freezing instructions.",
						"Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Rimmed baking sheets are best because butter may leak from the dough as it bakes. If you don&#8217;t have rimmed baking sheets, when it&#8217;s time to preheat the oven, place another baking sheet on the oven rack below to catch any butter that may drip.",
						"Take the dough out of the refrigerator and cut it in half. Wrap 1 half up and keep refrigerated as you work with the first half. (You can freeze half of the dough at this point, use the freezing instructions below.)",
						"Cut the first half of dough into 8 even pieces. This will be about 1/4 cup of dough per pastry. Roll each into balls. Flatten each into a 2.5 inch circle. Use your fingers to create a lip around the edges. See photos and video tutorial if needed. Press the center down to flatten the center as much as you can so you can fit the filling inside. (Center puffs up as it bakes.) Arrange pastries 3 inches apart on a lined baking sheet. Repeat with second half of dough.",
						"Spoon 2 teaspoons of fruity filling or 1 Tablespoon of cheese filling inside each.",
						"Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Brush on the edges of each shaped pastry.",
						"This step is optional, but I very strongly recommend it. Chill the shaped pastries in the refrigerator, covered or uncovered, for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. See recipe note. You can preheat the oven as they finish up chilling.",
						"Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).",
						"Bake for 19-22 minutes or until golden brown around the edges. Some butter may leak from the dough, that&#8217;s completely normal and expected. Feel free to remove the baking sheets from the oven halfway through baking and brush the dough with any of the leaking butter, then place back in the oven to finish baking. (That&#8217;s what I do!)",
						"Remove baked pastries from the oven. Cool for at least 5 minutes before icing/serving.",
						"Whisk the icing ingredients together. If you want a thicker icing, whisk in more confectioners’ sugar. If you want a thinner icing, whisk in more milk or cream. Drizzle over warm pastries and serve.",
						"Cover leftover iced or un-iced pastries and store at room temperature for 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Thaw before serving. Before enjoying, feel free to reheat leftover iced or un-iced pastries in the microwave for a few seconds until warmed.",

						"To make the wontons, take a wrapper, and add about a teaspoon of filling. Overstuffed wontons will pop open during the cooking process and make a mess. Use your finger to coat the edges with a little water (this helps the two sides seal together).",
						"For shape #1:",

						"Fold the wonton in half so you have a triangle shape. Bring together the two outer corners, and press to seal (you can use a little water to make sure it sticks).",
						"Keep assembling until all the filling is gone (this recipe should make between 40 and 50 wontons). Place the wontons on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking.",
						"At this point, you can cover the wontons with plastic wrap, put the baking sheet/plate into the freezer, and transfer them to Ziploc bags once they’re frozen. They’ll keep for a couple months in the freezer and be ready for the fryer whenever you’re ready.",
						"To conserve oil, use a small pot to fry the wontons. Fill it with 2 to 3 inches of oil, making sure the pot is deep enough so the oil does not overflow when adding the wontons. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry in small batches, turning the wontons occasionally until they are golden brown.",
						"If you have a small spider strainer or slotted spoon, you can use it to keep the wontons submerged when frying. This method will give you the most uniform golden brown look without the fuss of turning them. Remove the fried wontons to a sheet pan lined with paper towels or a metal cooling rack to drain.",
						"To make one or all of the sauces, simply mix the respective ingredients in a small bowl, and you’re ready to eat!",

The loaf is ready when it&#39;s golden, a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean, the cake slightly springs back under gentle pressure at center, and the edges of the loaf are just starting to pull away from the sides of the pan. Allow cake to cool in the pan for 20 minutes on a cooling rack. Lift cake out and transfer to a cooking rack. Cool completely at room temperature before icing or covering (about 2 hours).",

Scrape down your bowl several times to make sure the butter is getting whipped. Add the cream cheese and beat another  minute. Scrape down the bowl.",
						"Sift in the powder sugar, add the vanilla, and orange zest then mix on low until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Taste for sweet adjustment and add another tablespoon of powered sugar if desired. To loosen the icing, you can add a few teaspoons of orange juice.",
						"Store the icing in a lidded container, in the refrigerator, if not icing the bread after it cools. Bring to room temperature before slathering!",

An uniced cake can set covered at room temperature for up to three days.Ice the Cake:Once the loaf cake is cool and just before serving, spread the icing evenly over the top of the cake. Slice and share within three hours.Individual Pieces:Once the loaf is cool, slice the loaf and share with a dollop or slather of cream cheese icing. *Uniced carrot cake bread is lovely toasted or warmed, then slathered with cream cheese icing!",

Before serving, pull the cake from the fridge and rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the fats to soften. Food safety says cheese should set out for no more than three hours. An uniced loaf cake can be stored covered at room temperature for up to three days.",
						"To Freeze: This cake freezes beautifully, iced or uniced. Simply allow the cake to cool completely, ice the cake or not, then freeze individual pieces on a sheet pan. Once frozen wrap snugly in plastic wrap or store in a lidded container. Store in freezer then thaw at room temperature for about two hours before enjoying. If iced, take the plastic wrap off before thawing so the icing doesn&#39;t stick.I&#39;ve only tested freezing the iced cake for up to two days. Uniced will freeze well for up to two weeks.
