## Getting Started

### Installation

The installation instructions are written in the [installation section](https://recipya.musicavis.ca/docs/installation/) of the documentation.

### Building the Project

Follow these steps to build the project yourself:
1. Clone the project.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reaper47/recipya.git
   ```
2. Install the required [dependencies](https://recipya.musicavis.ca/docs/development/intro/#dependencies).
3. [Build](https://recipya.musicavis.ca/docs/development/build/) the project.

Alternatively, you may use the [development container](https://recipya.musicavis.ca/docs/development/devcontainer/).
Recipya's Docker [container](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/tree/main/.devcontainer) includes all the necessary tools and dependencies 
you need to start writing code quickly.

### Updating

#### Docker

Please follow these [instructions](https://recipya.musicavis.ca/docs/installation/docker/#updating-your-container-1) 
to update your Docker instance.

#### Release build

If you installed a release build of Recipya, i.e. v1.0.0, then the software will notify you once an update is available. 
You can [self-update](https://recipya.musicavis.ca/docs/features/updater) the application from the settings dialog.

Let's explain the mechanism developers. Basically, a cron job is run [every three days](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/blob/main/internal/jobs/jobs.go#L70-L82)
to check whether there is a new GitHub release. If so, the update indicators in the UI will be enabled. Once the user presses 
the "Update" button, the latest release is fetched, unpacked and the application restarted.
